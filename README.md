# The Book of Embassy

To build the book, you need `npm` to install the Antora doc system. 

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies needed to build the docs.

## Running a build with local sources (useful during development)

```
make local
```

## Running a build with default sources

```
make
```

The book is automatically published to https://embassy.dev by a CI job.
